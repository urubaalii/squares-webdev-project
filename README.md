# Squares-WebDevelopment-Project

This is a colorful square generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On load, 30–50 squares are randomly placed inside a fixed area. Users can add more squares or change the colors of all squares with a button click. Clicking a square either brings it to the front or removes it, depending on its position. A fun interactive project that shows off dynamic DOM manipulation and styling.
